    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>
        Butter chicken is an iconic Indian dish. It is the bread and butter (pun 
        absolutely intended) of the Indian and Indian diaspora communties. Also, it is a
        highly revered and praised dish in the Pakistani community as well, given the close-knit
        ties between North Indian and Pakistani cuisines. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Butter chicken is a hybrid and continuation of the long-standing tradition 
        of chicken curry and the restaurant-ization of chicken curries in North Indian
        cuisine.
