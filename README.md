TOP recipes project 

Recipes are perfect for html learning and demonstration. We can gain practice with links and images, unordered lists, and ordered lists as we provide information for recipes. 

We also gain practice with the headings, paragraphs, and can use the strong and emphasis tags as well if we want to bold/italicize text and continue to learn all of the tools that html provides us.
